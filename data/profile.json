    "I'm a founder/operator and hands-on builder who ships real systems, not just prototypes. My work sits at the intersection of business VoIP/telecom operations, customer onboarding + billing + provisioning workflows, internal tools and portals, web infrastructure + automation, and compliance-minded operational design.",
    "My primary company is Telocall LLC, where I serve as CEO/Owner, delivering hosted PBX workflows, device deployment patterns, and customer-facing telecom operations. I also build product software, including JBond.app.",
    "I design onboarding and lifecycle automations — plan selection, DID acquisition, billing events, suspension/reactivation logic — to reduce support load and speed up activation. I lead platform and vendor transitions while maintaining continuity for customers and internal operations."
