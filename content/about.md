# Abe Sherman

I’m Abe Sherman — a founder/operator focused on building practical systems that help businesses communicate, sell, and support customers.

I’m the CEO/Owner of Telocall LLC, where we deliver business VoIP and telecom solutions and help companies modernize phone workflows.

Alongside telecom, I build software tools and internal portals that automate real operations (billing flows, onboarding, contracts, support workflows, compliance checklists, and day-to-day tooling).

## What I’m working on
- **Telocall** — business VoIP + operational tooling around communications.
- **Tavnit / TDev** — a development branch focused on building custom systems and white-label portals (separate entity/agreements from Telocall; Telocall is used for marketing/outreach).
- **JBond.app** — a relationship/communication AI web app (product + onboarding + member areas).

## What I’m good at
- Shipping pragmatic software that matches real-world workflows
- Systems thinking: simplifying operations, automating the boring parts
- Telecom & VoIP fundamentals + customer-facing implementations
- Web apps, portals, integrations, internal tools

## Technical interests
I’m hands-on with servers, automation, and tooling (Linux environments, web stacks, scripting, and practical integrations). I’m active on GitHub under **Abe-Telo**.

## Writing & sharing
I’ve published telecom-related articles for Telocall.

If you want to collaborate or hire me for a build, this site will include the best way to reach me.
